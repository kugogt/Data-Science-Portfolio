# 📚 Marco Rosato – Data Science

👋 *Ciao*!  
I'm **Marco Rosato**, a master's student in **Data Science** at the University of Milano-Bicocca.  
I hold a bachelor's degree in **Statistics and Information Management (SGI)**, and this portfolio is a collection of my academic and personal projects in the field of Data Science & Machine Learning.  

The goal of this portfolio is to provide clear and unified access to each project repository.
