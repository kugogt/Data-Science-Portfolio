# 📚 Marco Rosato – Data Science

*Ciao*!  
I'm **Marco Rosato**, a master's student in **Data Science** at the University of Milano-Bicocca.  
I hold a bachelor's degree in **Statistics and Information Management (SGI)**, and this portfolio is a collection of my academic and personal projects in the field of Data Science & Machine Learning.  

The goal of this portfolio is to provide clear and unified access to each project repository.

Inside you’ll find several folders, each corresponding to a specific course project.

## Personal Projects
In addition to coursework, I’ve worked on personal projects to deepen my knowledge and explore areas of interest. Each project has its own repository:

- [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/kugogt/Housing-Price-Prediction) – End-to-end ML pipeline for regression, feature engineering, model stacking and interpretation.  
- [SRRGAN | U-Net & PatchGan](https://github.com/kugogt/SRRGAN-U-Net-PatchGan/tree/main) – Super-Resolution & Restoration with U-net and PatchGan.
